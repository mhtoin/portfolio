## GitHub Integration

This portfolio now automatically fetches projects from GitHub when Sanity CMS is unavailable or not configured. The integration:

- Fetches public repositories from the specified GitHub username
- Filters out forks and archived repositories
- Automatically determines featured projects based on stars and recent activity
- Extracts technologies from repository topics and language
- Provides fallback mock data when the GitHub API is unavailable

To configure:
1. Set `PUBLIC_GITHUB_USERNAME` in your environment variables
2. The system will automatically fall back to GitHub when Sanity is not available
